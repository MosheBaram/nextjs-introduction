## Moshe Baram - Next.js - Introduction to Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The idea of this project is to showcase the basics of Next.js, its capabilities, and common issues.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
